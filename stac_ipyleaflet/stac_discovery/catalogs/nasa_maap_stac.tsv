This global dataset is divided into 10x10 degree tiles, consisting of seven files per tile. All files contain unsigned 8-bit values and have a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second per pixel or approximately 30 meters per pixel at the equator. The available layers are treecover2000, gain, lossyear, and datamask. treecover2000: Tree cover in the year 2000, defined as canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5m in height. Encoded as a percentage per output grid cell, in the range 0–100. gain: Forest gain during the period 2000–2012, defined as the inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the study period. Encoded as either 1 (gain) or 0 (no gain). lossyear: Forest loss during the period 2000–2017, defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. Encoded as either 0 (no loss) or else a value in the range 1–17, representing loss detected primarily in the year 2001–2017, respectively. datamask: Three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped land surface (1), and permanent water bodies (2). 	not-provided

Backscatter for each pixel is classified as either ""forest"", defined as the tree covered land with an area larger than 0.5 ha and canopy cover over 10%, or ""non-forest"".  The map is generated yearly from 2007 through 2017.  Data is distributed as binary data files with ENVI headers.  The dataset provides spatiotemporal homogeneous forest classification which can be used to help understand and monitor responses to environmental changes. "	not-provided
