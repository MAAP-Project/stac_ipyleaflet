# STAC ipyleaflet Docs

### This documentation section provides *sample* Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to extend the current version of the `stac_ipyleaflet` library beyond the included widgets. 

_Browse through the sample notebooks within the `/sample_notebooks` directory to learn how to load and visualize geospatial datasets that are outside of a STAC Catalog, but within your cloud development environment or publicly accessible over the web._
